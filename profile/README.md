## ðŸ”§ OneTakeda GitHub

OneTakeda is an organization within GitHub that provides enterprise standard tools & expertise to onboard your projects & accelerate your delivery.

The main motivation behind this organization is to align different business units with the industry standards and avoid repetitive solutions for the same set of collective problems. 
We make sure there is never a version mismatch on your deliverables by relying on GitHub version control features.  it's important to highlight we provide a solution that supports distributed workforce (employees, consultants, partners, etc.) which is controlled by access policies with specified permissions to users and repositories.

why would you want to reinvent the wheels, unless you plan on learning more about wheels and worse would be if you encounter a flat tire :smile: using our project will save engineers time and effort as we automate all your software workflows, Build, test, and deploy your code in a secure cloud environment.
